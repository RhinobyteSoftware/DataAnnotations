# Rhinobyte.DataAnnotationsValidation

This repo contains the code to build the Rhinobyte.DataAnnotations library for .Net

This library was started primarily to provide a thread safe alternative to using the `[Range]` attribute for
`DateTime` properties. I was frustrated that the Microsoft maintainers chose not to fix the [thread safety issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1143),
despite an easy non-contention solution being available.
